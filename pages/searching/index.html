                        With this algorithm you can find and/or count a specific 
                        item in a large unsorted array. If the array is sorted 
                        then we recommend the use of the binary search algorithm.

                        This algorithm allows you to find if an item is present in 
                        a sorted array in logarithmic time; it is the fastest 
                        algorithm for this task. Be aware that if the array is not 
                        sorted the algorith will not work as expected.
